Tic-Tac-Toe with an unbeatable AI

JavaScript based Tic-Tac-Toe implementation.
The AI uses a Alpha Beta Pruning algorithm and is hard to beat, if at all.
Alpha Beta Pruning is improving the Minimax algorithm by eliminating any paths that are not worth pursuing, because there's no additional gain following the other branches of the decision tree - it will not improve the final outcome or score of the game.
